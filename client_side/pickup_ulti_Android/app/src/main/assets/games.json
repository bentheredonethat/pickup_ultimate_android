Most of our players are from Key Biscayne but we have a good amount who come from the mainland. We range in age from 16 to 60 (average is late 20's), mostly male. We are pretty liberal with the rules (ie. No hold/stall count or bricks) but most violations are penalized one way or another. \n\n     Any newcomers, from any skill range, are always welcome. If you are extremely serious about ultimate this is *NOT* for you.

We tend to run with a few more than regulation rather than having people substitute to keep everyone playing the whole time. We usually run two games due to the number of people and occasionally 3 games at once. Usually were anywhere between 28-38 people on a given Sunday and a smaller game on Fridays. We play almost every holiday. Best way to get updates is our facebook group: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/137436576315988/\n\nWe currently play from 5:30 Pm to 8:00 Pm on Sundays and currently on Fridays from 5:30 Pm to 8:00 Pm also. Fridays turnout is usually a little smaller and one game instead of two. \n\nSometimes Olmos Basin Sports Complex (Soccer Fields) are flooded in which case we play on our backup fields at McCullough and Basse next to the baseball fields.\n\nCome play some ultimate with us on a Sunday in the near future!",

Good mix of all skill levels. Good place for new people to get started playing. We tend to run with a few more than regulation rather than having people substitute to keep everyone playing the whole time. We usually run two games due to the number of people and occasionally 3 games at once. Usually were anywhere between 28-38 people on a given Sunday and a smaller game on Fridays. We play almost every holiday. Best way to get updates is our facebook group: <br /><br />https://www.facebook.com/groups/137436576315988/<br /><br />We currently play from 5:30 Pm to 8:00 Pm on Sundays and currently on Fridays from 5:30 Pm to 8:00 Pm also. Fridays turnout is usually a little smaller and one game instead of two. <br /><br />Sometimes Olmos Basin Sports Complex (Soccer Fields) are flooded in which case we play on our backup fields at McCullough and Basse next to the baseball fields.<br /><br />Come play some ultimate with us on a Sunday in the near future!<br /><br />"

Our season normally runs from April through October.\n\nWe're looking for more interest so we can split into set teams and organize a bracketed tournament! To start though, we’d like to see who’s interested in playing and how many of you there are. If you have questions e-mail Dalton Mackie at keywees.ultimate@gmail.com or just show up ready to play. We have a few discs and cones already on hand so just remember to bring a dark and light colored shirt.\n\nFeel free to invite others and beginners are welcome!",

Most players are students at the Linköping University but we also have local veterans, national team players, exchange students and youth players. We are always happy to have new players and we make sure everyone get to know the basics and get involved in the game. We usually start with some throwing and drills and then play a game.<br /><br />From late April until the beginning of October we play outdoors, default is the grassfield in the middle of \"Rydsskogen\" at \"Motionscentrum\" Sunday 17.00-19.00 and Tuesday 18.00-20.00.<br /><br />Indoor Nov-April:<br />- Wednesday (probably at \"Kungsbergshallen\") 21:30-23.00.<br />- Sunday at \"Rydsskolans sporthall\" (address Björnkärrsgatan 15 D) 19.00-21.00.<br /><br />Please visit our facebook group for the latest updates!<br /><br />www.facebook.com/groups/175405842512236<br /><br />This info was last updated 2 Aug 2016.<br /><br />"

You down? Come join! Bring your friends. We have people of all skill levels; no experience, lots of experience, doesn't matter. Age; preferably high school age and older, but we are willing to incorporate kiddo's at some point in the night. If you are planning on coming a dozen times or more, please bring $100 to solidify your spot. If you are just dropping in for one night please bring  $10 if you can. If not, no worries, but this is a non-profit organization so any little bit helps! Other than that, all you need is cleats, lite and dark shirt, water, and tons of high-5's. So come check out what we mountain folk are all about and we'll see you at the bottom!<br /><br />"
